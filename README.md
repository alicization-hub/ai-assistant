# Project AI Chatbot Assistant.

This project focuses on the development of a cutting-edge **AI Chatbot Assistant** using a modular architecture for scalability and flexibility. The system is built upon a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, fine-tuned with a custom dataset to ensure domain-specific accuracy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

This project uses the following core technologies to support LLM interactions, embeddings storage, and containerized deployment:

- **NestJS** ‚Äî Server framework (TypeScript), modular and testable.
- **OpenAI** ‚Äî LLM and embeddings via the OpenAI API/SDK.
- **Drizzle ORM** ‚Äî Typesafe ORM / query builder for PostgreSQL (drizzle-orm).
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector** ‚Äî Primary database; use the `pgvector` extension for vector search (requires installing the `vector` extension).
- **WSL2** (recommended for Windows) ‚Äî Linux-compatible development environment for local Docker/Postgres.
- **Docker** ‚Äî Containerization and service orchestration (see `docker-compose.yml`).

Quick notes:

- Ensure environment variables are configured (DB credentials, ports, OpenAI key, etc.).
- The `docker/postgres-init` folder contains initialization SQL scripts that run on first Postgres init (files placed into `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`).
- Drizzle schema and migration files are under `src/modules/drizzle`.

Notes: If you run Docker on Windows, we recommend using WSL2 for a Linux-compatible environment.

## pgvector guidance & troubleshooting

Options to enable pgvector:

1. Use a Postgres image that includes pgvector.
2. Build a custom Postgres image that installs pgvector (recommended for production).
3. Install the extension on an existing server by connecting and running:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

Important:

- Initialization scripts placed in `docker/postgres-init` run only on first initialization (when the Postgres data directory is empty). If you already have a `pg_data` volume with data, those scripts won't run.
- To enable pgvector on an existing DB, connect with `psql` and run the `CREATE EXTENSION` command above.
- To verify availability:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name = 'vector';
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

More detailed setup instructions will be provided soon. In the meantime, here's a brief overview of what you'll need:

**Dependencies**: Install project dependencies using your preferred package manager, use one of them `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, Example using `bun`:

```bash
bun install
```

**Environment Variables**: Configure your environment variables for database connection.

## üöÄ Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```bash
bun run start:dev
```

## üì¶ Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
bun run build
```
